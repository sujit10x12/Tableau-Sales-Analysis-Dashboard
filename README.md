## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation Steps (in Tableau)

### 1. Import and Clean Fact Table
```
‚Üí Imported 'FactOrders' into Tableau
‚Üí Used Tableau's built-in Data Interpreter to:
   - Remove nulls
   - Fix headers
```

### 2. Extract Country from `OrderId`
Used Tableau's `SPLIT()` function to extract the country code from `OrderId`.

```tableau
SPLIT([OrderId], "-", 1)
```
### 3. Apply Aliases
Renamed country codes for clarity.

```text
CA ‚Üí Canada  
US ‚Üí United States
```

### 4. Import and Join Fact and Dimension Tables
Performed **Inner Joins** on ID fields:

```text
FactOrders.CustomerID     = Customers.CustomerID  
FactOrders.ProductID      = Products.ProductID  
FactOrders.PostalCodeID   = PostalCodes.PostalCodeID  
FactOrders.ShipModeID     = ShipModes.ShipModeID  
```
Renamed the resulting combined table to **SalesData**

### 5. Hide Unnecessary Columns from **Dimension Tables**
```text
‚Üí Hidden columns:
   - CustomerID
   - ProductID
   - PostalCodeID
   - ShipModeID
```

### 6. Union Additional Records
Unioned the cleaned `SalesData` table with `FactOrders18-19`.
